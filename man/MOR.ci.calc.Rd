\title{Calculate the median odds ratio and CI using bootstrap}
\usage{
MOR.ci.calc(formula = NULL, data = NULL, grp.var.t = NULL,
  set.subset = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a character containing the formula for the glmer function}

\item{data}{a (list of) data.frame(s) or data.table(s), or a MIDS object
containing the data on which the model was fitted}

\item{grp.var.t}{the grouping variable, e.g.: "country"}

\item{set.subset}{a logical vector, indicating whether a subject is included or not in the analysis}
}
\description{
Calculate the median odds ratio and CI using bootstrap (1000 replicate samples). Note: this takes a long time... So maybe plan a Titanic night with your colleagues while using this function.
